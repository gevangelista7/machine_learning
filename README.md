Project assignment for CPE775 - Machine Learning / PEE / UFRJ
This work consist mainly in proposing and implementing a shallow model that can have better results then a deep learning in some task.
For this purpose I extract a Light Gradient Boosting Machine model to predtict the faillure of a Smart Grid. The operations conditions dataset is the presented in "V. Arzamasov, K. Bohm, and P. Jochem, “Towards concise models of grid stability,” in 2018 IEEE International Conference on Communications, Control, and Computing Technologies for Smart Grids (SmartGridComm). IEEE, 2018, pp. 1–6."

The final paper-like report (in portuguese) is the file "CPE775 - Gabriel Evangelista - Previsão de falhas de redes inteligentes descentralizadas por aprendizado de máquina.pdf"
